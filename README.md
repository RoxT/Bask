Band Finder web app using Flask framework.

Bands can sign up and post their events with date, time, and location. Users see them on a map and can search by band. 
A 'featured' splash image at the top will show images for the band.

Current state: Most of the back end stuff is done
In a few weeks I will go back a clean it up a bit and make it pretty and ready for publishing
